## Raw data
The raw files available publicly at [Wikimedia Downloads](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/) are larger than GitHub's default upload limit of 2 GiB, so I have not included them here. If you want to download them yourself, the file names you should look for are `pages-meta-current.xml` (which contains the current text content of all pages) and `categorylinks.sql` (which indicates which pages are in which categories).
